There once was a group of friends who loved to explore. They would travel together all over to investigate abandoned buildings. 
The trio was in search of the other worldly experiences that so many deserted structures are known for. Every summer, the three 
would pack their belongings and travel to whatever notorious site was scheduled for that year. In the past, they would scour 
the buildings, but not have similar experiences as the previous travelers would scout the site. This year was different. In the
past the three would pick the lesser of the paranormal buildings to explore, but this year, they were traveling to one of the best
known haunted buildings ever known.
